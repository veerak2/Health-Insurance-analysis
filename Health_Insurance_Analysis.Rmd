This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(glue)
```

```{r}
df <- read_xlsx("C:/College/Courses/SDM/Assignments/Health Insurance/Health-Insurance-analysis/HealthInsurance.xlsx", sheet = "Data")
```

### Data Exploration

```{r}
dft <- df
```

```{r}
dft
```


Converting the binary columns to factors using list apply

```{r}
names <-c('healthins','female','lowincome','firmlocation','private','married','poverty','midincome','msa','prioritylist','vgh','fph','blackhisp','hisp','black')
dft[,names] <- lapply(dft[,names],factor)
```


```{r}
summary(dft)
```
We only have people who are aged above 65.

Combining multiple binary columns to one categorical column
 
 "Why write more code when less code do work" - Kavin, 2021


```{r}
colSums((is.na(dft)))
```

```{r}
status_function <- function(status){
  if(nchar(status) > 1){
    if(status == "good"){
    val <- "good"
    }
    else if(status == "verygood"){
    val <- "verygood"
    }
    else if(status == "fair"){
    val <- "fair"
    }
    else if(status == "poor"){
    val <- "poor"
    }
    else{
    val <- "unknown"
    }
    return(val)
  }
}

```

```{r}
names <- c('verygood','good','fair','poor')
dft$status <- dft[,names] %>%  apply( 1, function(x) names(x)[as.logical(x)])
dft$status <- lapply(dft$status, function(x) ifelse(identical(x, character(0)), "unknown", x))
dft$status <-  as.factor(unlist(lapply(dft$status,FUN = status_function)))
```

filtering out ssi ratio > 1
```{r}
dft <- dft %>% filter(ssiratio < 1)
```

There is discrepancy in the data. It shows people with no health insurance have private insurance. 

Keeping this data as we dont know which one is true. We will just include one or the other in the models.

```{r}
dft %>% filter(healthins == 0 & private == 1) %>% count()
```
```{r}
dft %>% filter(status == "unknown") %>% count()
```

```{r}
df <- subset(dft,select = -c(verygood,good,fair,poor,firmlocation,firmsize,black,hisp,married,educyr,poverty,midincome,msa,prioritylist,vgh,fph))
```

### EDA

Distribution of Dependent variable: Medical expense

```{r}
hist(df$medexpense)
hist(df$logmedexpense)
```
```{r}
hist(df$income)
hist(df$logincome)
```

How important is having health insurance?

```{r}
df %>% 
  add_count(healthins,name={"total"}) %>% 
  mutate(healthins = glue("{healthins}({total})"),       
         fct_reorder(healthins,medexpense)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = healthins,y=logmedexpense)) +
    geom_boxplot() 
```

```{r}
ggplot() +
  aes(x = df$logmedexpense, y = df$logincome,color = df$blackhisp) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) + labs(color = "Black or hisp")
```
Does health status matter?

```{r}
df %>% 
  add_count(status,name={"total"}) %>% 
  mutate(status = glue("{status}({total})"),       
         fct_reorder(status,medexpense)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = status,y=medexpense)) +
    geom_boxplot() 
```
```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(logmedexpense,fill = status)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.5) 
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  add_count(private,name={"total"}) %>% 
  mutate(private = glue("{private}({total})"),       
         fct_reorder(private,medexpense)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = private,y=logmedexpense)) +
    geom_boxplot() 
```
```{r}
df %>% 
  add_count(blackhisp,name={"total"}) %>% 
  mutate(blackhisp = glue("{blackhisp}({total})"),       
         fct_reorder(blackhisp,medexpense)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = blackhisp,y=logmedexpense)) +
    geom_boxplot() 
```
```{r}
df %>% 
  add_count(female,name={"total"}) %>% 
  mutate(female = glue("{female}({total})"),       
         fct_reorder(female,medexpense)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = female,y=logmedexpense)) +
    geom_boxplot() 
```
```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(illnesses, y = medexpense), ) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(logincome, y = logmedexpense)) +
  geom_point() + xlim(0,6) + geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
df %>% filter(ssiratio < 1) %>% 
  filter(ssiratio < 0.5) %>% select(medexpense) %>% summarise(median(medexpense))
```
Having medical expense based on firm size

```{r}
dft %>% filter(firmsize > 0) %>% 
  summary()
```


```{r}
df %>% filter(ssiratio < 1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(ssiratio, y = medexpense)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```
```{r}
nums <- unlist(lapply(df, is.numeric))
PerformanceAnalytics::chart.Correlation(df[,nums])
```


```{r}
ols_model1 <- lm(logmedexpense ~ healthins + private + female + blackhisp + income + status + agesqrd + illnesses,data=df)
summary(ols_model1)
plot(ols_model1)
summary(ols_model1, cor=T)   
hist(ols_model1$residuals)
hist(ols_model1$fitted.values)

print("Normality - KS test : ") # since sample greather than 2000
norm <- rnorm(8407)
ks.test(norm, ols_model1$res)  
print("Bartlett's test : ") 
bartlett.test(list(ols_model1$residuals,ols_model1$fitted.values))
print("Durbin-Watson's test : ") 
lmtest::dwtest(ols_model1)
car::vif(ols_model1)
```

The ols model fails to pass the assummptions. Hence the estimates cannot be replied upon. To be specific, it fails the homoscedastic and independene tests.



Trying with weighted least squares as we can see in the residual vs fitted plot, there is fanning inwards for higher values
```{r}
wt = 1/ols_model1$fitted.values^2
wls <- lm(logmedexpense ~ healthins + private + female + blackhisp + income + status + agesqrd + illnesses,data=df,weights = wt)
summary(wls)
plot(wls)
hist(wls$residuals)
hist(wls$fitted.values)

print("Normality - KS test : ") # since sample greather than 2000
norm <- rnorm(8407)
ks.test(norm, wls$res)  
print("Bartlett's test : ") 
bartlett.test(list(wls$residuals,wls$fitted.values))
print("Durbin-Watson's test : ") 
lmtest::dwtest(ols_model1)
car::vif(wls)
```



```{r}
ols_model2 <- lm(logmedexpense ~ private + female + blackhisp + ssiratio + illnesses + agesqrd ,data=df)
summary(ols_model2)
plot(ols_model2)
summary(ols_model2, cor=T)   
```

```{r}

ols_model1 %>% vcov %>% diag() %>% sqrt() %>% round(3)
```

```{r}
stargazer::stargazer(ols_model1,wls,ols_model2, title="Results", type = "text")
```
Inferences made from the best model which is the weighted model:

•	Do people with health insurance have higher or lower medical expense than people without health insurance, when other variables are controlled? By how much? Why do you think this happens?
The marginal effect of health insurance suggests that people with health insurance will likely pay 10% more than people without health insurances on medical expenses ie while keeping all other variables constant. This could be possible because insurances do not cover everything like long-term care, dental, eye exams etc, even medicare does not cover these.

•	Do people with private insurance pay more or less than people with public insurance? By how much?
The marginal effect of private insurance suggests that people with private insurance spend 1% lesser than people with public insurance while keeping all other variables constant.

•	Do people with more illnesses have higher or lower medical expense than people with less illnesses? By how much?
The marginal effect of illnesses suggests that if the number of illnesses increases by 1 then medical expense would go up by 52% keeping all other variables constant.

•	Do males have higher medical expense than females? By how much?
The marginal effect of females suggests that females spend 5% more on medical expenses than males while keeping all other variables constant. 

•	Do older people have higher medical expense than younger people? By how much?
The dataset does not have information on younger people.

•	Do minority groups (Blacks/Hispanics) have higher or lower medical expenses than the non-minority population? By how much?
The marginal effect of blackhisp suggests that minority groups (Blacks/Hispanics) spend 18% less on medical expenses than non-minority groups while keeping all other variables constant. 

•	How do people’s income level relate to their medical expense, when controlled for other factors? By how much?
The marginal effect of income suggests that if annual income increases by $1000 then medical expenses would go up by 0.1% keeping all other variables constant
